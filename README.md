# UX/UI project

Team: Peter, Nori, Lucy, Esraa

A place to store our group project for the UX and UI week

## The Problem
- Build an app to process and track payments for a (fictitious) charity
- Unravel (or sidestep) a very complex existing system of data entry and payment processing, mostly stored on excel spreadsheets
- Simply payments to reduce the barriers to contributions to the charity

## Prototype

You can find a prototype of our website [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/f3419bb3-0841-4780-8c34-6531d0a85d6e/)

## User testing 

### INTRO FOR TESTERS
This is what we should tell them before we begin testing.

We have designed a payment system for a charity that provides chef training to help people get work in restaurants.
People who receive this training are asked to make payments back to the charity for a year after their training or up to the amount of £3000.
We’d like you to imagine that you’ve received training from this charity and that you’re trying to make a payment.
It would be ideal if you could talk us through what you’re doing and tell us about your experience as you use the system. 
We’d love any thoughts and feedback you may have afterwards as well. 

### Testing notes

**DON’T SHARE THIS WITH TESTERS!**

- Record every user screen, to detecct their cursor movement,and figure out where they struggle
- What do we want to find out?
- Is there a clear call to action on the landing page?
- Is there a clear journey through the app?
- If they have trouble, can they get help?
- Is it clear if they’ve sent a message or completed a payment?
- Can they log out?
- Are there any pain points? Is anything unclear?
- Probably the most awkward part of the process is the page immediately after login - make careful notes on what they think of this, whether they struggle to understand what’s required of them?
- Does the interface inspire confidence?

### Feedback from our testers

- **Tester 1**

  - IPhone user
  - Pain point 1: it’s unclear what the graph visualizes. 
  - Questions: is there a suggested payment? (she likes the idea of suggested payment)
  - It’s very simple and easy to use. 
  - Pain point 2: She misses a little bit of personality. Some kind of visualization that is more friendly, shows each of the installments, something that shows where I stand in my payment. Visualize how many installments i’ve done and how many i’ve left. We can do piechart, but we can be more creative than that :D. 
  - Suggestion 1: something like: a button: Having trouble paying this month? If  I can’t pay this month, I should be able to contact to charity and ask for renegotiating my plan. 

- **Tester 2**

  - Sony Experia (now)  IPhone 5 (earlier) she prefers to pay on desktop because it feels safer for her.  She discussed this issue (phone vs desktop payments) with her friends and they agreed  that they are afraid that when they are on the gone and using a phone, they can loose the signal, the screen is too small...etc. 
  - We were explaining too many things for her to understand (explaining the context, Peter’s opinion)
  - She likes the need help button because it catches her attention.
  - She thinks the border is too thick, the text is too small compared to the image.
  - She misses the commas for the thousands. (£4000 should be £4,000).
  - She thinks it is not straightforward what the graph is supposed to represent. Is it supposed to show my monthly payments? - She would prefer a progress bar (centered).
  - She misses debit card from the payment options. 
  - She misses colours :D . It is a UX test that is why we don’t have colours.
  - She likes the flow but she really misses colours :D 

- **Tester 3**

  - IPhone user
  - There is nothing telling him that it is a password field (add labels to the password and input field ). 
  - He was expecting a general FAQ section.
  - He is confused about the graph. He is unsure what it’s showing him. 
  - We shouldn’t say ‘welcome to chef pay’ after he’s logged out because that’s confusing. Change the message.
  - Messaging system: need improvements. How will I hear back from my message?

- **Tester 4**

  - IPhone user
  - Looks clear and simple. He likes the ‘Welcome…’ and the highlight on the submit button.
  - On phone the username and password are too close together.
  - He likes that the amount of payment is highlighted, so it suggests that he can change it. (and he can if we had a real product).
  - Improve the charts. Payments per month, to see how much he’s paid each month.
  - The border of the need help? Button is too thick. Bit distracting, too big.
  - Can’t get back from pay screen to homepage.
  - Spread out the payment page. Everything is in the middle.
  - It would be nice to have a header.
  - Chat app button are usually at the bottom right? (I think chatbots yes..but messages not always? Let’s discuss it )
  - It could be rather a home thing than a back because it redirects you to the homepage.
  - Homepage: say what the total actually is rather than percentage of total.
  - It would be nice to see the previous payments. 

- **Tester 5** 

  - IPhone user
  - Why it says submit rather than login?
  - No form for messaging app.
  - Percentage of total? 
  - Chart is confusing :D
  - The message should have a box because is not straightforward what she is supposed to do. When they will get back to her?
  - More paying options!!
  - Expiry day?  Just month of year.
  - Add labels to the boxes!! Because it can be confusing after se forgets what the original ghost message said…
  - Why is it in a box? If it is not a box? (I missed about which page she said this. )
  - She wants to know when her next payment is due after she gets back to the homepage after a successful payment.
  - She doesn’t know whether there are any repercussions if she doesn’t pay.
  - Give a choice: show job opportunities..nugging parent all time :D 
  - No warning or sense of urgency for me to pay.
  - It feels like you are my parent telling me off.
  - Being more friendly on the app.

### Conclusions from user testing

- bar graph is a disaster -> we should make a progess bar or dots instead.
- logout button on every page (not messages).
- Back arrow from paypal and VISA payment pages.
- additional and friendlier page between login and payment page -> E.g. remind them why training was great
- The back arrow on the page where you have submitted a message is at the bottom rather than the top left (which is where it is on the other pages). This needs to be moved to the top left. You can see from the user testing video below that the user instinctively reached for the button at the top, only to find that it wasn't there!
