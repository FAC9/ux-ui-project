## Conclusions from user testing

- bar graph is a disaster -> we should make a progess bar or dots instead.
- logout button on every page (not messages).
- Back arrow from paypal and VISA payment pages.
- additional and friendlier page between login and payment page -> E.g. remind them why training was great
