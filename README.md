# UX/UI project

Team: Peter, Nori, Lucy, Esraa

A place to store our group project for the UX and UI week

## The Problem
- Build an app to process and track payments for a (fictitious) charity
- Unravel (or sidestep) a very complex existing system of data entry and payment processing, mostly stored on excel spreadsheets
- Simply payments to reduce the barriers to contributions to the charity

## Prototype
